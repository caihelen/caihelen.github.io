I'm currently in my last year as a medical student at the **Yale School of Medicine**.

**Clinically**, I'm interested in internal medicine and the power of longitudinal care. 

**In research**, I'm interested in data science (particularly genomics), and leveraging existing tools to shed light on cellular mechanisms. I am currently pursuing an MHS degree with the [Pattabiraman Lab](https://www.pattabiramanlab.com/).

## Education
- MD Candidate, Yale University School of Medicine (_May 2026_)
- MHS Candidate, Yale University School of Medicine (_May 2026_)

## Previous Work
- In consultation with Smita Krishnaswamy and the TAs of her Deep Learning course, I collaborated with two graduate students from the Yale School of the Environment (Tobias Muellers and Jennifer Gao) to develop a novel tool for molecular discovery in the application of generating new non-bioaccumulative pesticides. We presented our project at the inaugural [AI at Yale symposium](https://ai.yale.edu/symposium-2025).
- During medical school, I worked with Lais Osmani in the Kang Lab at the Yale School of Medicine to describe a new monocyte subpopulation involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. [[preprint]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5172473)
- In work for my undergraduate senior thesis in Applied Mathematics, I worked with Thierry Emonet and Nirag Kadakia at Yale University on a project implemented in Python to develop algorithms to pick stereotyped behaviors out of trajectories of fruit flies responding to an odor.
- In work for my undergraduate senior thesis in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, I worked with Alvaro Sanchez and Chang-Yu Chang at Yale University on a project implemented in Python to determine the nature of how microbial communities come together and coalesce. [[doi]](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2111261119)
- In _2018_, I worked with the Ana Širović and Camille Pagniello at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography to develop an image-processing machine learning pipeline, implemented in Matlab. [[github]](https://github.com/cpagniel/FishOASIS/tree/master/post_processing/automation).
- In _2017_, I worked with the Air Force Research Laboratories on a signal-processing project, implemented in Matlab.
- In _2015_, I was a participant in the Astrophysics curriculum of the [[Summer Science Program]](https://summerscience.org/) at NMT, where I learned Python and wrote code to determine the orbit of a near-Earth asteroid.

## Other Projects
- When the [Summer Science Program](https://summerscience.org/) turned fully virtual in the summer of 2020, I developed a 4-part tutorial to teach the Biochemistry participants Python and equip them with the skills needed to code a rudimentary motif finder. [[github]](https://github.com/caihelen/python-tutorials)
- I am a student producer on the Primary Care Pearls med-ed podcast.

## Awards
- I was awarded the James G. Hirsch Endowed Medical Student Research Fellowship to fund one year of research in pursuit of the MHS degree from the 2024-2025 academic year.
- I was awarded a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant (ETA) award to live and teach in Estonia from 2020-2021 (ultimately, for 6 months in 2021). Some very fond memories and conversations from that time [are published here](https://medium.com/estonian-memories).
